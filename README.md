# Support for this mod has been dropped - [Rebind Everything](https://github.com/forthbridge/rebind-everything) can handle rebinding Spearmaster, and much more!

# Provides a Remix config to rebind Spearmaster's spear extraction!

## Manual Installation
You can find most workshop mods hosted on RainDB! (http://www.raindb.net/)
  
  They will be kept up to date, but are only updated on a roughly weekly basis, so unfortunately if a mod is new / recently updated, you may have to wait for the latest release!
